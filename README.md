# Magic-Eight-Ball
In this project, we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript. The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.

# Tasks
#1 In the first line of the program, define a variable called userName that is set to an empty string.
If the user wants, they can enter their name in between the quotation marks.

#2 Below this variable, create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not. If the user enters a name — like 'Jane' — use string interpolation to log Hello, Jane! to the console. Otherwise, simply log Hello!.

#3 Create a variable named userQuestion. The value of the variable should be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball.

#4 Write a console.log() for the userQuestion, stating what was asked. You can include the user’s name in the console.log() statement, if you wish!

#5 We need to generate a random number between 0 and 7.

Create another variable, and name it randomNumber. Set it equal to this expression, which uses two methods (Math.floor() and Math.random()) from the Math library.
